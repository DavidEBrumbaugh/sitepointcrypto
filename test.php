 1937 Enigma Manual - English Translation


I. General.

1. The Enigma encryption machine is a secret object in terms of the secret item regulation 
(Verschlußsachen-Vorschrift) (II. Dv. 99). According to the regulations of this provision, it is to be kept 
locked up.

2. Every user of the encryption machine must be aware of the fact that the construction of the machine requires 
careful usage and maintenance, so that the machine is ready for use at any time.

 
II. Preparation for Using the Machine.

3. Before starting the machine, it is to be checked for proper operation. For this, the wooden protection box is 
to be opened, the holding fixture (Picture I, 1) to be opened by lifting the spring-loaded buttons (I, 2), 
the holding levers (I, 3) to be pivoted down, whereupon the cover plate (I/II, 4) can be opened which exposes 
the thumbwheel (II/IV,5).

4. The thumbwheels (II/IV, 5) are to be rotated against each other, so that the contacts of the encryption 
cylinders become bare. Subsequently, the cover plate (I/II, 4) is to be closed and secured by the the holding 
levers (I, 3).

5. To clean the key contacts, all keys (II, 6) are to be pressed down firmly multiple times, and let snap back 
rapidly. While doing this, one key is to be held down to avoid unnecessary progression of the cylinders.

6. The battery switch (II, 7) is to be set to „dunkel" (dark) when the battery is fresh. As soon as the battery 
voltage degrades after long use, the setting „hell" (light) is to be used for improved brightness of the bulbs. 
Using the setting „hell" too early will lead to premature bulb burn out.

7. In bright sunshine, and to spare the user’s eyes, it is advisable to remove the green Zellon panel (I/II, 8) 
from the wooden cover by lifting and turning the spring-loaded buttons (I/II, 9), and to secure it on top of the 
transparent letters using the same mechanism. The Zellon panel attenuates the light of the bulbs and covers all 
letters so that only the lit letter is visible.

8. For protection against bright sunlight the device can be shaded through pulling the joints of the cover 
hinge (II, 14) out towards the front, and closing the wooden cover down partially.

9. There is a sheet holder (I, 42) on the inside of the wooden cover that allows documents to be held 
comfortably in front of the operators eyes during encryption.
